# The Movie Collector app
An responsive website for movie enthusiasts. It's a place to store movie recommendations from your friends and family (screw those terrible algorithms!). Once you've watched a movie, you can leave notes on your experience and thoughts about why you watched it. These notes will help others decide if it's a good movie for them.
